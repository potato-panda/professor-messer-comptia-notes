# Floor plans
### Overlay the wired and wireless network with the existing architectural layout
- wires in the ceiling
- AP locations
### Can be useful for patch panel labels
- associate a desk with a number
### Used for planning
- avoid heavy machinery
- identify closet locations

# Physical network maps
### Follows the physical wire and device
- can include physical rack locations

# Distribution frames
### Passive cable termination
- punch down blocks
- patch panels
### Usually mounted on the wall or flat surface
- uses a bit of real-estate
### All transport media
- copper, fiber, voice and data
### Often used as a room or location name
- it's a significant part of the network

# Main Distribution Frame (MDF)
### Central point of the network
- usually in a data center
### Termination point for WAN links
- connects the inside to the outside
### Good test point
- test in both directions
### This is often the data center
- the central point for data

# Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)
### Extension of the MDF
- a strategic distribution point
### Connects the users to the network
- uplinks from the MDF
- workgroup switches
- other local resources
### Common in medium to large organizations
- users are geographically diverse

# Logical network maps
### Specialized software
- Visio, OmniGraffle, Gliffy.com
### High level views
- WAN layout, application flows
### Useful for planning and collaboration
# Managing your cables
### ANSI/TIA/EIA 606
- Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Commercial Buildings
### Presentation of information
- reports, drawings, work orders
### Pathway, space, grounding
- identifiers, labeling
### Cables
- identifiers, labels, color coding, bar coding
# Labeling
### Everything is tagged and labeled
- a standard format
### Port labeling
- CB01-01A-D088
- CB01 - Main facility
- 01A - Floor 1, space A
- D088 - Data port 88
### All cables are documented
- central database

# Site surveys
### Determine existing wireless landscape
- sample the existing wireless spectrum
### Identify existing AP
- you may not control all of them
### Work around existing frequencies
- layout and plan for interference
### Plan for ongoing site surveys
- things will certainly change
### Heat maps
- identify wireless signal strengths

# Audit and assessment report
### Validate existing security policies
- are we following our own rules?
### Internal audits
- self-imposed checks
- validate permissions, check access logs, verify user account status
### External audits
- third-party performs the checks
- may be required for compliance regulations
# Baselines
### Broadly defined
- what does it mean to you?
- application response time, network throughput, etc
### Point of reference
- accumulated knowledge
- examine the past to predict the future
- useful for planning
# Other baselines
