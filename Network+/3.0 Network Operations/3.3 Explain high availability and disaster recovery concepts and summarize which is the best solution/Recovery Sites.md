# Site Resiliency
### Recovery site is prepped
- data is synchronized
### A disaster is called
- business processes failover to the alternative processing site
### Problem is addressed
- this can take hours, weeks, or longer
### Revert back to the primary location
- the process must be documented for both directions
# Cold site
### No hardware
- empty building
### No data
- bring it with you
### No people
- bus in your team
# Hot site
### An exact replica
- duplicate everything
### Stocked with hardware
- constantly updated
- you buy two of everything
### Applications and software are constantly updated
- automated replication
### Flip a switch and everything moves
- this may be quite a few switches
# Warm site
### Somewhere between cold and hot
- just enough to get going
### Big room with rack space
- you bring the hardware
### Hardware is ready and waiting
- you bring the software and data
# Cloud site
### Use an established cloud provider
- can provide enough resources for the recovery process
### No separate facility to manage
- online configuration
### Costs can be flat fee or based on use
- more data, more cost
### The data and applications still need to be moved
- large data storage requirements may create a challenge
