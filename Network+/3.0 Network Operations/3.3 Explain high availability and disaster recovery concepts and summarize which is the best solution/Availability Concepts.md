### Recovery point objective (RPO)
- how much data loss is acceptable?
- bring the system back online; how far back does data go?
### Mean time to repair (MTTR)
- time required to fix the issue
### Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- predict the time between outages
# Network device backup and restore
### Every device has a configuration
- IP addresses, security settings, port configurations
- most devices allow the configuration to be downloaded and uploaded
- configurations may be specific to a version of operating code or firmware
