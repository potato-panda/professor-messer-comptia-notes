# VoIP phone
### Voice over Internet Protocol
- instead of analog phone line or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
### A relatively complex embedded system
- can be an important resources
### Each device is a computer
- separate boot process and network connections
- individual configurations
- different capabilities and functionalities
# Printer
### Color and B&W output
- paper docs
- photos
### All-In-One - AIO
- printer, scanner, copier, fax
# Connectivity
- Ethernet
- 802.11 wireless
- USB
- Bluetooth/Infrared
# Access control devices
### Card reader
- access with a smart card
### [[Study/professor-messer-comptia-notes/Network+/4.5/Physical Security#Biometrics|Biometric authentication]]
- fingerprint, retina, voiceprint
### Usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometric
- your actual fingerprint isn't usually stored
### Ethernet connected
- IP address configured static or DHCP
# Cameras
### CTC (Closed circuit television)
- can replace physical guards
### Camera features are important
- motion recognition can alarm and alert when something moves
- object detection can identify a license plate or person's face
### Often many different cameras
- networked together and recorded over time
# Surveillance systems
### Video/audio surveillance
- embedded system in the cameras and the monitoring systems
### IP addressable
- multicast video
- High definition
# HVAC
### Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
- thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer
### A complex science
- not something you can properly design by yourself
- must be integrated into the fire system
### PC manages equipment
- makes cooling and heating decisions for workspaces and data centers
- network connectivity is critical
# IoT (Internet of Things) devices
### Appliances
- refrigerator
### Smart devices
- smart speakers respond to voice commands
### Air control
- thermostats, temperature control
### Access
- smart doorbell
### May require a segmented network
- limit any security breaches
# SCADA / ICS
###  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
- large-scale, multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
### PC manages equipment
- power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment
- facilities, industrial, energy, logistics
### Distributed control systems
- real-time information
- system control
### Requires extensive segmentation
- no access from the outside
