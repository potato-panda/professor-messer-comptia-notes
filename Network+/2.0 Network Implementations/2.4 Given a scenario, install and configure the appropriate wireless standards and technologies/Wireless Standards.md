### Wireless networking (802.11)
- managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEE 802)
### Many updates over time
- check with IEEE for the latest
### The Wi-Fi trademark
- Wi-Fi Alliance handles interoperability testing
# 802.11a
### One of the original 802.11 wireless standards
- October 1999
### Operates in the 5GHz range
- or other freq with special licensing
### 54 Mb/s
### Smaller range than 802.11b
- higher freq is absorbed by objects in the way
- many rules-of-thumb calculate 1/3rd the range of 802.11b or 802.11g
### Not commonly seen today
# 802.11b
### Also and original 802.11 standard
- October 1999
### Operates in the 2.4Ghz range
### 11Mb/s
### Better range than 802.11a
- less absorption problems
### More frequency conflicts
- baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth
### Not commonly seen today
# 802.11g
### An "upgrade" to 802.11b
- June 2003
### Operates in the 2.4 GHz range
### 54Mb/s
- similar to 802.11a
### Backwards compatible with 802.11b
### Same 2.4GHz freq conflict problems as 802.11b
# 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
### Update to 802.11g, 802.11b, and 80211a
- October 2009
### Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4GHZ
- 40MHz channel widths
### 600 Mb/s
- 40MHz mode and 4 antennas
### 802.11n uses MIMO
- multi-input multiple-output
- multiple transmit and receive antennas
# 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
### Approved in Jan 2014
- significant improvements over 802.11n
### Operates in the 5GHz band
- less crowded, more freq (up to 160MHz channel bandwidth)
### Increased channel bonding
- large bandwidth usage
### Denser signaling modulation
- faster data transfers
### Eight MU-MIMO downlink streams
- twice as many streams as 802.11n
- nearly 7 Gb/s
# 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
### Approved in Feb 2021
- successor to 802.11ac/Wi-Fi 5
### Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4GHz
- 20,40,80, and 160 MHz channel widths
### 1,201 Mb/s per channel
- a relatively small increase in throughput
- 8 bi-directional MU-MIMO (Multi-user MIMO) streams
### Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
- works similarly to cellular communication
- improves high-density installations
