# Cellular networks
### Mobile devices
- "cell" phones
- 4G, 5G
### Separate land into "cells"
- antenna coverage a cell with certain freq
### 2G networks
- GSM - Global System for Mobile communications
- CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access
### Poor data support
- originally used circuit-switching
- minor updates for some packet switching

# GSM
### Global System for Mobile Communications
- mobile networking standard
### 90% of the market
- originally an EU standard
- worldwide coverage
### Used by AT&T AND T-Mobile in the U.S.
- move your SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone
### Original GSM standard used multiplexing
- everyone gets a little slice of time
# CDMA
### Code Division Multiple Access
- everyone communicates at the same time
- each call uses a different code
- the codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side
### Used by Verizon and Sprint
- handsets are controlled by the network provider
- not much adoption elsewhere
# 3G
### 3rd Generation
- introduced in 1998
### Upgraded data connectivity over 2G
- incremental 3G updates improved speeds
- usually several Mb/s
### Bandwidth improvements allowed new functionality
- GPS
- Mobile television
- video on demand
- video conferencing
# 4G/LTE
### Long Term Evolution (LTE)
- a "4G" technology
- converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers)
- based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
- Standard supports download rates of 150Mb/s
### LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
- standard supports download rates of 300Mb/s
# 5G
### 5th generation cellular networking
- launched worldwide in 2020
### Significant performance improvements
- at higher freq
- eventually 10Gb/s
- slower speeds from 100-900Mb/s
### Significant IoT impact
- bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
- larger data transfers
- faster monitoring and notification
- additional cloud processing
