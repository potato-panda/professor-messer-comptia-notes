# NAT (Network Address Translation)
### Estimated there are over 20 billion devices connected to Internet (and growing)
- IPv4 supports around 4.29 billion addresses
### Address space for IPv4 is exhausted
- there are no available addresses to assign
### How does it all work?
- We use NAT
### This isn't the only use of NAT
- NAT is useful in many situations
