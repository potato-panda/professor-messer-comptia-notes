# Media Converter
### OSI Layer 1
- physical layer signal conversion
### Extend a copper wire over a long distance
- convert it to fiber, and back again
### You have fiber
- the switch only has copper ports
### Almost always powered
- especially fiber to copper

# Transceiver
### Both a transmitter and receiver
- usually in a single component
### Provides a modular interface
- add the transceiver that matches your network
### Many different types
- and many designs

# Duplex communication
### Two fibers
- transmit and receive

### Duplex transceivers

See that there is a dedicated transmitting side and a receiving side

# Bi-directional (BiDi) transceivers
### Traffic in both directions with a single fiber
- uses two different wavelengths
### Reduce number of fiber runs by half

# SFP and SFP+
### Small Form-Factor pluggable (SFP)
- commonly used to provide 1 Gb/s fiber
- 1 Gb/sRJ45 SFPs also available
### Enhanced Small Form-factor plugabble (SFP+)
- exactly the same physical size as SFPs
- supports data rates up to 16Gb/s
- commonly with 10 Gigabit Ethernet

# QDFP
### Quad Small Form-factor pluggable
- 4-channel SFP = Four 1 Gb/s = 4 Gb/s
- QSFP+ is 4-channel SFP+ = Four 10 Gb/s = 40 Gb/s
### Combine four SFPs into a single transceiver
- Cost savings in fiber and equipment
### Bi-directional (BiDi) QSFP and QSFP+
- additional efficiency over a single fiber run
