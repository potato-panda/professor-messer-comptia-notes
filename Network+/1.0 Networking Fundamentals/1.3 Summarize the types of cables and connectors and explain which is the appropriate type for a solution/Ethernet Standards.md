# Ethernet
### The most popular networking technology in the world
- standard, common, nearly universal
### Many different types of Ethernet
- speed, cabling, connectors, equipment
### Modern Ethernet uses twisted pair copper or fiber

### BASE (baseband)
- single frequency using the entire medium
- broadband uses many frequencies, sharing the medium
# 10 and 100 megabit Ethernet
### 10BASE-T (twisted pair)
> the "T" denotes twisted pair 
- two pair
- Cat3 cable minimum
- 100 meter max distance
### 100BASE-TX
- "Fast Ethernet"
- two pair
- Cat5 minimum twisted pair copper wires
- 100 meter max distance
# 1000BASE-TX
### Gigabit Ethernet over Cat5
- 4 pair balanced twisted-pair
### Cat5
- Category 5 is deprecated, we now use Cat5e
- a shift to using all four pair
- 100 meter max distance
# 10GBATE-T
### 10 Gig Ethernet over copper
- 4-pair balanced twisted-pair
### Frequency use of 500Mhz
- well above the 125 MHz for gigabit Ethernet
### Cat6
- unshielded: 55 meters
- shielded: 100 meters
### Cat6A (augmented)
- unshielded or shielded: 100 meters

# 40GBASE-T
### 40 gigabit per second Ethernet
- 4-pair balanced twisted-pair
### Cat8 cable
- up to 30 meters
# 100 megabit Ethernet over fiber
### 100BASE-FX
- pair of multimode fiber
- used the same fiber as FDDI
- laser components
- 400 meters (half-duplex), 2 kilometers (full-duplex)
### 100BASE-SX
- less expensive version of the above
- LED optics
- 300 meters max distance
# Gigabit Ethernet over fiber
### 1000BASE-SX
- Gigabit Ethernet using short wavelength laser
- usually over multimode fiber
- 220 meters to 550 meters, depending on fiber type
### 1000BASE-LX
- using long wavelength laser
- multi-mode fiber up to 550 meters
- single-mode fiber up to 5 kilometers
# 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber
### 10GBASE-SR (Short Range)
- multi-mode fiber
- 26 to 400 meters, depending on fiber specs
### 10GBASE-LR (Long Range)
- single-mode fiber
- 10 kilometers max distance
# WDM
### Wavelength-Division Multiplexing
- bidirectional communication over a single strand of fiber
### Use different wavelengths for each carrier
- different "colors"
### CWDM (Coarse WDM)
- 10GBASE-LX4 uses four 3.125 Gb/s carriers at four different wavelengths
### DWDM (Dense WDM)
- multiplex multiple OC (Office Central) carriers into a single fiber
- add 160 signals, increase to 1.6Tb/s
