# UPC and APC
### Controlling light
- laws of physics apply
### Return loss
- light reflected back to the source is weaker
### UPC (Ultra-polished connectors)
- Ferrule end-face radius polished at a zero degree angle
- has high return loss

Notice number the arrows
### APC (Angle-polished connectors)
- Ferrule end-face radius polish at an 8 degree angle
- lower return loss, generally higher insertion loss than UPC
