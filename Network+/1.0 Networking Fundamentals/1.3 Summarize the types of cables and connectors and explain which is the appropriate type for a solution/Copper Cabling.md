# Importance of cable
### Fundamental to network communication
- incredibly important foundation
### Usually only get one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
- make it good
### Vast majority of wireless communications uses cables
- unless you're an amateur radio operator
# Twisted pair copper cabling
### Balanced pair operation
- two wires with equal and opposite signals
- transmit+ transmit- = / receive + , Receive-
### The twist the secret
- keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
- the opposite signals are compared on the other end
### Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates

# Copper cable categories

# Coaxial cable
### Two or more forms share a common axis
### RG-6 is used in television/digital cable
- and high-speed Internet over cable

# Twin axial cable
### Two inner conductors
- twins
### Common on 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ cables
- full duplex
- five meters
- low cost
- low latency compared to twisted pair
# Structed cabling standards
- International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
- defines classes of networking sstandards
- # Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
- - Standards, market analysis, trade shows, government affairs, etc.
-  ANSI/TIA-569: Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard

### Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
- **T568A and T568B**
# T568A and T568B termination
### Pin assignments from T568-B standard
- 8 conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling
### A and B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors
- assigns the A type pin-out to horizontal cabling
### Many organization traditionally use type B
- difficult to change mid-stream
### You can't terminate one side of the cable with type A and B on the other
- would cause confusion and technical problems
