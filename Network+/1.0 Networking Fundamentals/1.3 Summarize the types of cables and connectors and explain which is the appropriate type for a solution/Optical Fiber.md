# Fiber communication
### Transmission by light
- the visible spectrum
### No RF (Radio frequency) signal
- very difficult to monitor/tap in
### Signal slow to degrade
- transmission over long distances
### Immune to radio interference
- there's no RF

# Multimode fiber
### Short-ranged communication
- up to 2km
### Inexpensive light source
- i.e. LED

# Single-mode fiber
### Long-range communication
- up to 100km with processing
### Expensive light source
- laser beams
