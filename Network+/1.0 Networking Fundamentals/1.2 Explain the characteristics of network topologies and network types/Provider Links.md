# Satellite networking
- Communication to a satellite
	- Non-terrestrial communication
- High cost relative to terrestrial networking
	- 50 Mbit/s down, 3Mbit/s up are common
	- for Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites
- High latency
	- 250ms up/down
- High frequency, 2GHz
	- obstructions in Line of sight, rain fade and weaken/lose connectivity
# Copper
- Extensive installations
	- Relatively inexpensive
	- Easy to install and maintain
- Limited bandwidth availability
	- Physical limits electric signals through copper
- WAN
	- Cable modem, DSL
- Often combined with fiber
	- Copper on the local loop, fiber in the backbone
# DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
- ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line)
	- Uses telephone lines
		- Asymmetric because incoming and outgoing bandwidth and speeds are different
	- Down speeds are faster than upload (asymmetric)
		- ~10,000 foot limitation from central office (CO)
		- 200Mbit/s down / 20Mbits/ up are common
		- Greater speeds may be possible if close to CO
# Cable broadband
- Broadband
	- transmission across multiple frequencies
	- different traffic types
- Data on the "cable" network
	- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)
- High-speed networking
	- 50Mbits/s to 1000+Mbits/s are common
# Fiber
- High speed data communication
	- frequencies of light
- Higher installation cost than copper
	- more costly
	- difficult to repair and maintain
	- communicate over long distances
- Large installation in the WAN core
	- supports very high data rates
	- SONET rings, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
- Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
	- Business and home use
# Metro Ethernet
- Metro-E
	- Metropolitan-area network
	- contained regional area
- Connect your sites with Ethernet
	- A common standard
- The provider network is optical
	- Local fiber network
	- Wavelength-division multiplexing
	- High speed, multiple wavelengths of light
