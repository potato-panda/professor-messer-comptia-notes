# Cable crimpers
### "Pinch" the connector onto the wire
- coaxial, twisted pair, fiber
### Connect the modular connector to the Ethernet cable
- the final step of the process
### Metal prongs are pushed through the insulation
- the plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath

# A good crimp

# Crimping best-practices
### Get a good crimper
- and a good pair of electrician's scissors / cable snips
- and a good wire stripper
### Make sure you use the correct modular connectors
- differences between wire types
### Practice, practice, practice
- it won't take long to become proficient

# Punch-down tools
### "Punch" a wire into a wiring block
- 66 block
- 110 block
### Can be tedious
- every wire must be individually punched
### Trims the wires during the punch
- very efficient process
![[Pasted image 20240515173407.png]]
# Punch-down best-practices
### Organization is key
- lots of wires
- cable management
### maintain your twists
- your CAT6A cable will thank you later

### Document everything
- written documentation
- tags
- graffiti
# Tone generator
### Where does that wire go?
- follow the tone
### Tone generator
- puts an analog sound on the wire
### Inductive probe
- doesn't need to touch the copper
- hear through a small speaker
# Using the tone generator and probe
### Easy wire tracing
- even in complex environments
### Connect the tone generator to the wire
- modular jack
- coax
- punch down connectors
### Use the probe to locate the sound
- the two-tone sound is easy to find

# Loopback plugs
### Useful for testing physical ports
- or fooling your applications
### Serial / RS-232 (9/25 pin)
### Network connections
- Ethernet, T1, Fiber
### These are not cross-over cables

# TDR and OTDR
### Time Domain Reflectometer / Optical Time Domain Reflectometer
### Estimate cable lengths
### Identify splice locations
### Cable impedance information
### Signal losses
### Certify cable installations
### Locate copper or fiber breaks
![[Pasted image 20240515174723.png]]
# The TDR
### The TDR sends an electrical pulse down the cable
- a radar "ping"
### Impedance discontinuities cause a reflection
- the TDR calculates time and distance
### OTDR does the same with light
- optical cable reflection
![[Pasted image 20240515175015.png]]
# Using a TDR/OTDR
### Not an inexpensive tools
- costly, especially for fiber
### Requires additional training
- many features, many metrics
### Very, very powerful
- resolve your Layer 1 issues quickly
### Certify your cable plant
- validate the installation
# Multimeters
### AC voltage
- check wall outlet voltage
### DC voltage
- PC power supply output voltages
- CMOS battery power
### Continuity
- cable connectivity
- fuse status
- wire mapping
![[Pasted image 20240515175422.png]]
# Cable testers
### Relatively simple
- continuity test
- a simple wire map
### Can identify missing pins
- or cross wires
### Not usually used for frequency testing like
- crosstalk, signal loss, etc

# Taps and port mirrors
### Intercept network traffic
- send a copy to a packet capture device
### Physical taps
- disconnect the link, put a tap in the middle
- can be an active or passive tap
### Port mirror
- port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port ANalyzer)
- software-based tap
- limited functionality, but can work well in a pinch

# Fusion splicer
### Join the two ends of a fiber together
- minimal light loss, low reflection
### Multiple uses
- add a connector to the end of a fiber
- extends the length of the fiber
- remove a section of damaged fiber
### Fusion slicers use heat
- permanent connection
- just as string as the original fiber
### Requires some training
- and a relative expensive splicer
# Light meter
### Sometimes you just need to know how much light is getting through
- one of the most important things to know when installing fiber equipment
### Send a light (laser, LED) from one side
- measure the light power on the other
### Useful measurements when installing equipment
- are we getting enough light?
# Spectrum analyzer
### Managing wireless access points can be a challenge
- many signals, limited number of frequencies
### If file transfers are slow, is it the server or the wireless network?
- you'll need to examine everything
### View everything communicating in the wireless frequency spectrum
- visually see any conflicts or interference
