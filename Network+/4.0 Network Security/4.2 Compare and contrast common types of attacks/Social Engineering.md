# Phishing
### Social engineering with a touch of spoofing
- often delivered by email, text, etc
- very remarkable when well done
### Don't be fooled
- check the URL
- Don't click links in email or text
### Usually there's something not quite right
- spelling, fonts, graphics
# Tailgating and piggybacking
### Tailgating uses an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building
- the attacker does not have consent
- sneaks through when nobody is looking
### Piggybacking follows the same process, but the authorized person is giving consent
- hold the door, my hands are full of donuts boxes
- sometimes you don't be polite
### Once inside, there's little to stop you
- most security stops at the border
# Watch for tailgating
### Policy for visitors
- you should be able to identify anyone
### One scan, one person
- a matter of policy or mechanically required
### Access Control Vestibule / Airlock
- you don't have a choice
### Don't be afraid to ask
- who are you and why are you here?
# Shoulder surfing
### You have access to important information
- many people want to see
- curiosity, industrial espionage, competitive advantage
### This is surprisingly easy
- airports / flights
- hallway-facing monitors
- coffee shops
### Surf from afar
- binoculars / telescopes
	- easy in the big city
- webcam monitoring
# Prevent shoulder surfing
### Control your input
- be aware of your surroundings
### Use privacy filters
- it's amazing how well they work
### Keep your monitor out of sight
- away from windows and hallways
### Don't sit in front of me on your flight
- I can't help myself
