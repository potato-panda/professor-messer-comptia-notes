### Attackers never sleep
### Monitor all entry points
- logins, publicly available services, data storage locations, remote access
### React to security events
- account access, firewall rulebase, additional scanning
### Status dashboards
- get the status of all system at a glance
# Monitoring computing resources
### Systems
- auth = logins from strange places
- server monitoring - service activity, backups, software versions
### Applications
- availability - uptime and response times
- data transfer - changes in rates
- security notifs - from dev/manufacturer
### Infra
- remote access system - employees, vendors, guests
- firewall/ IPS reports - increase or type of attack
# Log aggregation
### SIEM or SEM (Security Information and Event Manager)
- consolidate many different logs to a central db
- servers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, SANs, cloud services
### Centralized reporting
- all info in one place
### Correlation between diverse systems
- view auth and access
- track app access
- measure and report on data transfers
# Scanning
### A constantly changing threat landscape
- new vuln discovered daily
- many diff business apps and services
- systems and people are always moving
### Actively check systems and device
- OS types and versions
- device driver versions
- installed apps
### Gather raw details
- a valuable db of info
# Reporting
### Analyze the collect data
- create "actionable" reports
### Status info
- number of devices up to date/in compliance
- devices running older OS
### Determine best next steps
- a new vuln is announced
- how many systems are vuln?
### Ad hoc info summaries
- prepare for unknown
# Archiving
### Takes average of ~9 months for company to ID and contain breach
- IBM security report, 2022
### Access to data is critical
- archive over an extended period
### May have a mandate
- state or fed law
- or org requirements
# Alerting
### Real-time notif of security systems
- increase in auth errors
- large file transfers
### Actionable data
- keep the right people informed
- enable quick response and status info
### Notif methods
- SMS/text
- email
- security console/SOC
# Alert response and remediation
### Quarantine
- a foundational security response
- prevent a potential security issue from spreading
### Alert tuning
- a balancing act
- prevent false positives and false negative
### An alert should be accurate
- ongoing process
- tuning improves with time
