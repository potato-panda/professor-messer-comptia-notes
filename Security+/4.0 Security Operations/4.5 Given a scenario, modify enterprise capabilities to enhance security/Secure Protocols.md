# [[Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities#Insecure protocol|Unencrypted network data]]
### Network traffic is important data
- everything must be protected
# Protocol selection
### Use a secure app protocol
- built-in encryption
### A secure protocol may not be available
- this may be a deal-breaker
### Secure and insecure app connections may be available
- it's common to run secure and insecure on different ports
### HTTP and HTTPS
- in-the-clear and encrypted web browsing
### The port number does not guaranteed security
- confirm the security features are enabled
- packet captures may be necessary
# Transport method
### Don't rely on the app
- encrypt everything over the current network transport
### 802.11 Wireless
- open access point: no transport-level encryption
- WPA3: all user data is encrypted
### VPN
- create an encrypted tunnel
- all traffic is encrypted and protected
- often requires third-party services and software
