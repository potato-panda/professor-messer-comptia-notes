# Vulnerability scanners
### Usually minimally invasive
- Unlike a pen test
### Port scan
- poke around and see what's open
### ID systems
- and security devices
### Test from the outside and inside
- don't dismiss insider threats
### Gather as much info as possible
- we separate wheat from chaff later
# [[Application Security#Static code analyzer]]
# Dynamic analysis (fuzzing)
### Send random input to an app
- fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing
### Looking for something out of the ordinary
- app crash, server error, exception
### 1988 class project at the University of Wisconsin
- "Operating System Utility Program Reliability"
- Professor Barton Miller
- The Fuzz Generator
# Fuzz engines and frameworks
### Many different fuzzing options
- platform specific, language specific, etc
### Very time and process resource heavy
- many, many different iterations to try
- many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests
### Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
- CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)

# Package monitoring
### Some apps are distributed in a package
- esp. open source
- supply chain integrity
### Confirm the package is legitimate
- trusted source
- no added malware
- no embedded vulnerabilities
### Confirm a safe package before deployment
- verify the contents
