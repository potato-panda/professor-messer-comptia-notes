# Dealing with false info
### False positive
- a vuln is ID that doesn't really exist
### Different than a low-severity vuln
- it's real, but it may not be your highest priority
### False negatives
- a vuln exists, but you didn't detect it
### Update to the latest signatures
- if you don't know about it, you can't see it
### Work with vuln detection manufacturer
- they may need to update their signatures for your env
# Prioritize vulnerabilities
### Not every vuln shares the same prio
- some may not be significant
- others may be critical
### Difficult to determine
- research has probably already been done
### Refer to public disclosures and vulnerability databases
- industry is well versed
- online discussion groups, public disclosure mailing lists
# CVSS
### National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/
- sync with the CVE list
- enhanced search functionality
### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
- quantitative scoring of a vulnerability - 0 to 10
- scoring standards change over time
- different scoring for CVSS 2.0 vs CVSS 3.x
### Industry collaboration
- enhanced feed sharing and automation
# CVE
### The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online
- almost all scanners give you a place to go
### [[#National Vulnerability Database https //nvd.nist.gov/]]
### [[Security Concepts#Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)|CVE]]
### Microsoft Security Bulletins: https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx
### Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively ID
- you have to check manually to see if system is vulnerable
- scanner gives you a heads-up
# Vulnerability classification
### Scanner looks for everything
- well, not everything - signatures are the key
### App scans
- desktop, mobile apps
### Web app scans
- software on a web server
### Network scans
- misconfig firewalls, open ports, vulnerable devices
# Exposure factor
### Loss of value or business activity if vuln is exploited
- usually expressed as a %
### A small DDoS may limit access to a service
- 50% exposure factor
### A buffer overflow may completely disable a service
- 100%
### Consideration when prioritizing
- worst possible outcome probably gets prio
# Environment variables
### What type of env is associated with this vuln?
- internal server, public cloud, test lab
### Prioritization and patching frequency
- device in an isolated test lab
- db server in the public cloud
- which env gets prio?
### Every env is different
- number and types of users (internal, external)
- revenue generating app
- potential for exploit
# Industry/organizational impact
### Some exploit have significant consequences
- the type of org is an important consideration
### Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare - February 2023
- ransomware - closed for 2 weeks
- diverted emergency cases, surgeries cancelled
### Power utilities - Salt Lake City, Utah, and LA County, California - March 2019
- DDoS attacks from unpatched known vuln
# Risk tolerance
### The amount of risk acceptable to an org
- impractical to remove all risk
### Timing of security patches
- patching immediately doesn't allow for proper testing
### Testing takes time
- while testing, you are vulnerable
### A middle ground
- may change based on severity
