### Pentest
- simulate an attack
### Similar to vulnerability scanning
- except we actually try to exploit the vulnerabilities
### Often a compliance mandate
- regular pent test by a 3rd-party
### NIST Testing and Assessment
# Rules of engagement
### An important document
- defines purpose and scope
- makes everyone aware of the test parameters
### Type of testing and schedule
- on-site physical breach, internal test, external test
- normal working h ours, after 6 PM only, etc
### The rules
- IP address ranges
- emergency contacts
- how to handle sensitive info
- in-scope and out-of-scope devices or apps
# Exploiting vulnerabilities
### Try to break into the system
- be careful; this can cause a denial of service or loss of data
- buffer overflows can cause instability
- gain privilege escalation
### You may need to try many different vulnerability types
- password brute-force
- social engineering
- db injections
- buffer overflows
### You'll only be sure you're vulnerable if you can bypass security
- if you can get through, the attackers can get through
# The process
### Initial exploitation
- get into the network
### Lateral movement
- move from system to system
- inside of network is relative unprotected
### Persistence
- once you're there, you need to make sure there's a way back in
- set up a backdoor, build user accounts, change or verify default passwords
### The pivot
- gain access to systems that would normally not be accessible
- use a vulnerable system as a proxy or relay
# Responsible disclosure program
### Takes time to fix a vuln
- software changes, testing, deployment, etc
### Bug bounty programs
- a reward for discovering vuln
- earn money for hacking a system
- document the vuln to earn cash
### A controlled info release
- research reports the vuln
- manufacturer creates a fix
- the vuln is announced publicly
