# Patching
### Most common mitigation technique
- we know vuln exists
- have patch file to install
### Scheduled vuln/patch notices
- monthly, quarterly
### Unscheduled patches
- zero day, often urgent
### Ongoing process
- patches keep coming
- easy way to prevent most exploits
# Insurance
### Cybersecurity insurance coverage
- lost revenue
- data recovery costs
- money lost to phishing
- privacy lawsuits costs
### Doesn't cover everything
- intentional acts, fund transfers, etc
### Ransomware has increased popularity of cybersecurity liability insurance
- applies to every org
# Segmentation
### Limit scope of an exploit
- separate devices into own networks/VLANs
### Breach would have limited scope
- it's not as bad as it could be
### Can't patch?
- disconnect from the world
- air gaps may be required
### Use internal NGFWs
- block unwanted/unnecessary traffic between VLANs
- ID malicious traffic on the inside
# [[Defence in Depth#Physical segmentation|Physical segmentation]]
# [[Defence in Depth#Logical segmentation with VLANs|Logical segmentation with VLANs]]
# Compensating controls
### Optimal security methods may not be available
- can't deploy patch right now
- no internal firewalls
### Compensate in other ways
- disable problematic server
- revoke access to the app
- limit external access
- modify internal security controls and software firewalls
### Provide coverage until patch is deployed
- or similar optimal security response
# Exceptions and exemptions
### Removing the vuln is optimal
- but not everything can be patched
### A balancing act
- provide service, but also protect data and systems
### Not all vulns share the same severity
- may require local login, physical access, or other criteria
### An exception may be an options
- usually a formal process to approve
# Validation of remediation
### The vuln is now patched
- does patch really stop exploit?
- did patch all vuln systems?
### Rescanning
- perform an extensive vuln scan
### Audit
- check remediated systems to ensure patch was successful deployed
### Verification
- manually confirm security of the system
# Reporting
### Ongoing checks are required
- new vulns are continuously discovered
### Difficult (or impossible) to manage without automation
- manual checks would be time consuming
### Continuous reporting
- number of ID vulns
- systems patched vs unpatched
- new threats notifs
- errors, exceptions, and exemptions
