### Automate and orchestrate
- you don't have to be there
- solve problems in your sleep
- monitor and resolve problems before they happen
### Need for speed
- script is as fast as computer
- no typing or delays
- no human error
### Automate mundane tasks
- you can do something more productive
# Automation benefits
### Save time
- no typing required
- run multiple times as needed
### Enforce baselines
- missing an important security patch
- automatically install when IDd
### Standard infra configs
- use a script to build default router config
- add firewall rules to new security appliance
- IP configs, security rules, standard config opts
### Secure scaling
- orchestrate cloud resources
- quickly scale up and down
- automation ensures proper security also scales
### Employee retention
- automate the boring stuff
- ease the workload
- minimize the mundane tasks
- employees work is rewarding instead of repetitive
### Reaction time
- computer is much faster than people
- event can be addressed immediately
- script doesn't need a wake-up call
### Workforce multiplier
- scripting works 24/7
- allows smart people do work on productive tasks
# Cases for automation
### User and resource provisioning
- on-boarding and off-boarding
- assign access to specific resources
### Guard rails
- set of automated validations
- limit behaviors and responses
- constantly check to ensure proper impl
- reduce errors
### Security groups
- assign or remove group access
- constant audits without human intervention
### Ticket creation
- automatically ID issues
- script email submissions into a ticket
### Escalation
- correct issues before involving a human
- if issues isn't resolved, contact on-call tech
### Controlling services and access
- automatically enable/disable services
- not set and forget
### Continuous integration and testing
- constant development and code updates
- securely test and deploy
### Integrations and APIs
- interact with third-party devices and services
- cloud services, firewalls, operating systems
- talk their language
# Scripting considerations
### Complexity
- many moving parts
- all parts have to reliably work together
### Cost
- takes money to create
- money to impl the automation
### Single point of failure
- what happens if script stops working?
- significant deal-breaker
### Tech debt
- patching problems may push issue down the road
- will be more expensive to fix later
### Ongoing supportability
- script works great now
- may not work great tomorrow
- plan for changes and updates
