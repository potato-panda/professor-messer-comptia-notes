### Collect and protect info relating to an intrusion
- many diff data sources and protection mechanisms
### RFC 3227 - Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving
- a good set of best practices
### Standard digital forensics process
- acquisition, analysis, and reporting
### Must be detail orientated
- take extensive notes
# Legal hold
### A legal technique to preserve relevant info
- prepare for impending litigation
- initiated by legal counsel
### Hold notif
- custodians are instructed to preserve data
### Separate repository for electronically stored info (ESI)
- many diff data sources and types
- unique workflow and retention requirements
### Ongoing preservation
- once notified, there's an ongoing obligation to preserve data
# Chain of custody
### Control evidence
- maintain integrity
### Everyone who contacts the evidence
- use hashes and digital signatures
- avoid tampering
### Label and catalog everything
- digitally tag all items for ongoing documentation
- seal and store
# Acquisition
### Obtain the data
- disk, RAM, firmware, OS files, etc.
### Some of data may not be on a single system
- servers, network data, firewall logs
### For virtual systems, get a snapshot
- contains all files and information about a VM
### Look for any left-behind digital items
- artifacts
- log info, recycle bins, browser bookmarks, saved logins, etc.
# Reporting
### Document findings
- for internal, legal proceedings, etc.
### Summary info
- overview of the security event
### Detailed explanation of data acquisition
- step-by-step method of the process
### The findings
- analysis of the data
### Conclusion
- professional results, given the analysis
# Preservation
### Handling evidence
- isolate and protect the data
- analyze the data later without alterations
### Manage the collection process
- work from copies
- manage the data collection from mobile devices
### Live collection has become an important skill
- data may be encrypted or difficult to collect after powering down
### Follow best practices to ensure admissibility of data in court
- what happens now affects the future
# E-discovery
### Electronic discovery
- collect, prepare, review, interpret, and produce electronic documents
### E-discovery gathers data required by the legal process
- does not generally involve analysis
- there's no consideration of intent
### Works together with digital forensics
- the e-discovery process obtains a storage drive
- data on the drive is smaller than expected
- forensics experts determine the data was deleted and attempted to recover the data
