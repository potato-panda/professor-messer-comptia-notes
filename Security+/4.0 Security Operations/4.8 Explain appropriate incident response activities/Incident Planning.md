# Root cause analysis
### Determine the ultimate cause of an incident
- find the root cause by asking "why"
### Create a set of conclusions regarding the incident
- backed up by the facts
### Don't get tunnel vision
- there can be more than a single root cause
### Mistakes happen
- the response to the mistake is the difference
# Threat hunting
### Constant game of cat and mouse
- find the attacker before they find you
### Strategies are constantly changing
- firewalls get stronger, so phishing gets better
### Intelligence data is reactive
- you can't see the attack until it happens
### Speed up the reaction time
- use tech to fight
