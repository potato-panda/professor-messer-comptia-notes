# Physical penetration testing
### OS security can be circumvented by physical means
- modify the boot process
- boot from other media
- modify or replace OS files
### Physical security is key
- prevent access by unauthorized individuals
### Access and test physical security
- can you enter a building without a key?
- what access is available inside?
- doors, windows, elevators, physical security processes
# Pentesting perspectives
### Offensive
- red team
- attack systems and look for vulns to exploit
### Defensive
- blue team
- ID attacks in real-time
- prevent any unauthorized access
### Integrated
- create an ongoing process
- ID and patch exploitable systems and services
- test again
# Working knowledge
### How much do you know about the test?
- many different approaches
### Known env
- full disclosure
### Partially known env
- mix of known and unknown
- focus on certain systems or apps
### Unknown env
- pen tester knows nothing about the systems under attack
- "Blind" test
# Reconnaissance
### Need info before attacking
- can't rush blindly into battle
### Gathering a digital footprint
- learn everything you can
### Understand the security posture
- firewalls, security configs
### Minimize the attack surface
- focus on key systems
### Create a network map
- ID routers, networks, remote sites
# Passive reconnaissance
### Learn as much as you can from open sources
- a lot of info public
- remarkably difficult to protect or ID
### Social media
### Corporate web site
### Online forums, Reddit
### Social engineering
### Dumpster diving
### Business organizations
# Active reconnaissance
### Trying the doors
- maybe one is unlocked
- don't open it yet
- relatively easy to be seen
### Visible on network traffic and logs
### Ping scans, port scans
### DNS queries
### OS scans, OS fingerprinting
### Service scans, version scans
