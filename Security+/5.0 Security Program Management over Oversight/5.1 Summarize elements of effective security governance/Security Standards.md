### A formal def for using security tech and processes
- complete documentation reduces security risk
- everyone understands the expectations
### These may be written in-house
- your requirements may be unique
### Many standards are already available
- ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
# Password
### What makes a good password?
- every org has their own requirements
- create a formal password complexity policy
### Define acceptable authn methods
- no local accounts, only LDAP to the AD database, etc
### Create policies for secure password resets
- avoid unauthorized resets and access
### Other password policies
- password change frequency, security password storage requirements, password manager option, etc
# Access Control
### How does an org control access to data?
- determine which info, at what time
- and under which circumstances
### Define which access control types can be used
- no discretionary, mandatory only, etc
### Determine how a user gets access
- require privilege documentation
### Document how access may be removed
- security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc
# Physical security
### Rules and policies regarding physical security controls
- doors, building access, property security
### Granting physical access
- different for employees vs visitors
### Define specific physical security systems
- electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc
### Additional security concerns
- mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc
# Encryption
### Define specific standards for encrypting and securing data
- all things cryptographic
- can include impl standards
### Password storage
- methods and techniques
### Data encryption minimums
- algo for data in use, in transit, at rest
- will probably be different for each data state
