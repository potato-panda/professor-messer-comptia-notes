# Qualitative risk assessment
### ID significant risk factors
- ask opinions about the significance
- display visually with traffic light grid or similar method

| Risk Factor             | Impact | Annualized Rate of Occurrence | Cost of Controls | Overall Risk |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Legacy Windows Clients  | Medium | High                          | Medium           | High         |
| Untrained Staff         | Low    | Medium                        | Low              | Medium       |
| Non Anti-virus software | Medium | High                          | Medium           | High         | 

# Quantitative risk assessment
### ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)
- how likely a hurricane will hit? in Montana? in Florida?
### Asset Value (AV)
- value of asset to the org
- includes cost of assets, effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc
### Exposure factor (EF)
- percentage of value lost due to an incident
- losing a quarter of value is .25
- losing the entire asset is 1.0
### SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
- what is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?
- asset value (AV) × exposure factor (EF)
- laptop stolen = $1,000 (AV) × 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)
### ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) × SLE
- 7 laptops stolen a year (ARO) × $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000
### The business impact can be more than monetary
- quantitative vs qualitative
# Impact
### Life
- most important consideration
### Property
- risk to buildings and assets
### Safety
- some envs are too dangerous to work
### Finance
- the resulting financial cost
# Likelihood and probability
### Risk likelihood
- a qualitative measurement of risk
- rare, possible, almost certain, etc
### Risk probability
- a quantitative measurement of risk
- a statistical measurement
- can be based on historical performance
### Often considered similar in scope
- can be used interchangeably in casual conversation

# Risk appetite and tolerance
### Risk appetite
- a broad description of risk-taking deemed acceptable
- amount of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk
- a highway's speed limit
- government authorities have set the speed limit
- the limit is an acceptable balance between safety and convenience
### Risk appetite posture
- qualitative description for readiness to take risk
- conservative, neutral, and expansionary
### Risk tolerance
- an acceptable variance (usually larger) from the risk appetite
- drivers will be ticketed when the speed limit is violated
- ticketing usually occurs well above the posted limit
- this tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic, etc
# Risk register
### Every project has a plan, but also has risk
- ID and document the risk associated with each step
- apply possible solutions to the IDed risks
- monitor the results
### Key risk indicators
- ID risks that could impact the org
### Risk owners
- each indicators is assigned someone to manage the risk
