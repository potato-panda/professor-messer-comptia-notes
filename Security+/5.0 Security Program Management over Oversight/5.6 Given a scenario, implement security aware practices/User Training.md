# Security awareness training
### Before providing access, train your users
- detailed security requirements
### Specialized training
- each user role has unique security responsibilities
### Also applies to third-parties

### Detailed documentation and records
- problems later can be severe for everyone
# User guidance and training
### Policy/handbooks

- physical attacks: USB drives in a FedEx envelope, unlocked building doors, etc.
- be ready for anything
### Insider threat
- difficult to guard against
- add multiple approvals for critical processes
- monitor files and systems as much as possible
- it should be very difficult to make an unauthorized change
### Password management
- many standards to choose from
- guide users with standard requirements (length, complexity, etc.)
- this is often controlled using technology (Group Policy)
### Removable media and cables
- unknown USB drives can contain malware
- unknown cables can be malicious
### Social engineering
- extensive and ongoing training
- the attackers are very good
- users are your front line defence
### Operational security
- view security from attacker's perspective
- users need to ID sensitive data
- keep the sensitive data private
### Hybrid/remote work env
