# Availability
### System uptime
- access data, complete transactions
- foundation of IT security
### A balancing act with security
- available, but only to the right people
### We spend a lot of time and money on availability
- monitoring, redundant systems
### An important metric
- often evaluated on total available time
# Resilience
### Eventually, something will happen
- can you maintain availability?
- can you recover? how quickly?
### Based on many different variables
- the root cause
- replacement hardware installation
- software patch availability
- redundant systems
### Commonly referenced as MTTR
- Mean Time To Repair
# Cost
### How much money is required?
- everything ultimate comes down to cost
### Initial installation
- very different across platforms
### Ongoing maintenance
- annual ongoing cost
### Replacement or repair costs
- you might need more than one
### Tax implications
- operating or capital expense
# Responsiveness
### Request info
- get a response
- how quickly did that happen?
### Especially important for interactive applications
- humans are sensitive to delays
### Speed is an important metric
- all parts of the app contribute
- there's always a weakest link
# Scalability
### How quickly and easily can we increase or decrease capacity
- this might happen many times a day
- Elasticity
### There's always a resource challenge
- what's preventing scalability
### Needs to include security monitoring
- increases and decreases as the system scales
# Ease of deployment
### An app has many moving parts
- web server, db, caching server, firewall, etc
### This might be an involved process
- hardware resources, cloud budgets, change control
### This might be very simple
- orchestration / automation
### Important to consider during the product engineering phase
- one missed detail can cause deployment issues
# Risk transference
### Many methods to minimize risk
- transfer risk to a third-party
### Cybersecurity insurance
- attacks and downtime can be covered
- popular with the rise in ransomware
### Remove internal losses
- outrages and business downtime
### Protect against legal issues from customers
- limit the costs associated with legal proceedings
# Ease of recovery
### Something will eventually go wrong
- time is money
- how easily can you recover?
### Malware infection
- reload OS from original media - 1 hour
- reload from corporate image - 10 mins
### Another important design criteria
- This may be critical to the final product
# Patch availability
### Software isn't usually static
- bug fixes, security updates, etc
### This is often the first task after installation
- make sure you're running the latest version
### Most companies have regular updates
- Microsoft's monthly patch schedule
### Some companies rarely patch
- this might be a significant concern
# Inability to patch
### What if patching wasn't an option?
### Embedded systems
- HVAC controls
- time clocks
### Not designed for end-user updates
- this is short-sighted
- esp. these days
### May need additional security controls
- firewall for your time clock
# Power
### Foundational element
- this can require extensive engineering
### Overall power requirements
- data center vs office building
### Primary power
- one or more providers
### Backup services
- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
- Generators
# Compute
### An app's heavy lifting
- more than just 1 CPU
### The compute engine
- more options available in the cloud
### May be limited to a single processor
- easier to develop
### Use multiple CPUs across multiple clouds
- additional complexity
- enhanced scalability
