# Physical isolation
### Devices are physically separate
- air gap between switch A and switch B
### Must be connected to provide communication
- direct connect, or another switch or router
### Web servers in one rack
- db servers on another
### Customer A on one switch, Customer B on another
- no opportunity for mixing data
# Physical segmentation
### Separate devices
- multiple units, separate infra
# Logical segmentation with VLANs
### Virtual LAN
- separate logically instead of physically
- cannot communicate between VLANs without a Layer 3 device / router
