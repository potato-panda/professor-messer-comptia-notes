### Match supply to the demand
- this isn't always an obvious equation
### Too much demand
- app slowdowns and outages
### Too much supply
- you're paying too much
### Requires a balanced approach
- add the right amount of people
- apply appropriate tech
- build the best infra
# People
### Some services require human intervention
- call center support line
- tech services
### Too few employees
- recruit new staff
- may be time consuming to add more staff
### Too many employees
- redeploy to other parts of org
- downsize
# Technology
### Pick a tech that can scale
- not all services can easily grow and shrink
### Web services
- distribute load across multiple web services
### DB services
- cluster multiple SQL servers
- split the database to increase capacity
### Cloud services
- services on demand
- seemingly unlimited resources (if you pay)
# Infrastructure
### The underlying framework
- app servers, network services, etc
- CPU, network, storage
### Physical devices
- purchase, configure, install
### Cloud-based devices
- easier to deploy capacity changes
