### Test yourselves before an actual event
- schedule update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc)
### Use well-defined rules of engagement
- do not touch the prod systems
### Very specific scenario
- limited time to run the event
### Evaluate response
- document and discuss
# Tabletop exercises
### Perform a full-scale disaster drill can be costly
- can time consuming
### Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
- you don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill
### Get key players together for a tabletop exercise
- talk through a simulated disaster
# Fail over
### A failure is often inevitable
- "when", not "if"
### We many be able to keep running
- plan for the worst
### Create a redundant infra
- multiple routers, firewalls, switches, etc
### If one stops working, fail over to the operational unit
- many infra devices and services can do this simultaneously
# Simulation
### Test with a simulated event
- phishing attack, password requests, data breaches
### Going phishing
- create a phishing email attack
- send to your actual user community
- see who bites
### Test internal security
- did the phishing get past the filter?
### Test the users
- who clicked?
- additional training may be required
# Parallel processing
### Split a process through multiple (parallel) CPUs
- a single computer with multiple CPU cores or multiple physical CPUs
- multiple computers
### Improved performance
- split complex transactions across multiple processors
### Improved recovery
- quickly ID a faulty system
- take the faulty device out of list of available processors
- continue operating with the remaining processors
