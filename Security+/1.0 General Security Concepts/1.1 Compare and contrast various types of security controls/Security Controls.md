# Security controls
### Security risks are out there
- many different categories and types to consider
### Assets are also varied
- Data, physical property, computer systems
### Prevent security events, minimize the impact, and limit the damage
- Security controls
# Control categories
### Technical controls
- controls implemented using systems
- operating system controls
- firewalls, anti-virus
### Managerial controls
- administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
- security policies, standard operating procedures
### Operational controls
- controls implemented by people instead of systems
- security guards, awareness programs
### Physical controls
- limit physical access
- guard shack
- fences, locks
- badge readers
# Preventative control types
### Preventative
- block access to a resource
- you shall not pass
### Prevent access
- firewall rules
- follow security policy
- guard shack checks all ID
- enable door locks
# Deterrent control types
### Deterrent

# Corrective control types
### Corrective

- reverse the impact of the event
- continue operating with minimal downtime
### Correct the problem
- restoring from backups can mitigate a ransomware infection
- create policies for reporting security issues
- contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity
- use a fire extinguisher
# Compensating control types
### Compensating
- control using other means
- existing controls aren't sufficient
- may be temporary
### Prevent the exploitation of a weakness
- firewall blocks a specific application instead of patching the app
- implement a separation of duties
- require simultaneous guard duties
- generator used after power outage
# Directive control types
### Directive
