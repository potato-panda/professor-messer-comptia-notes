### Combination of principles
- the fundamentals of security
- sometimes referenced as the ACI Triad to differentiate from CIA
### Confidentiality
- prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
### Integrity
- messages can't be modified without detection
### Availability
- systems and networks must be up and running
# Confidentiality
### Certain information should only be known to certain people
- prevent unauthorized information disclosure
### Encryption
- encode messages so only certain people can read it
### Access controls
- selectively restrict access to a resource
### Two-factor Authentication
- additional confirmation before information is disclosed
# Integrity
### Data is stored and transferred as intended
- any modification to the data would be identified
### Hashing
- map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length
### Digital signatures
- mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
### Certificates
- combine with a digital signature to verify a individual
### Non-repudiation
- provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine
# Availability
### Information is accessible to authorized users
- always at your fingertips
### Redundancy
- build services that will always be available
### Fault tolerance
- system will continue to run, even when a failure occurs
### Patching
- stability
- close security holes
