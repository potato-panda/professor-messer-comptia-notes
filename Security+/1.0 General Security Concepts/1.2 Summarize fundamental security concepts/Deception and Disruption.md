# Honeypots
### Attract the bad guys
- and trap them there
### The "Attacker" is probably a machine

### Constant battle to discern the real from the fake

- servers, workstations, router, switches, firewalls
### Honeynets
- build a larger deception network with one or more honeypots
### More than one source of information
- stop spammers - https://projecthoneypot.org
# Honeyfiles
### Attract the attackers with more honey
- create files with fake information
- something bright and shiny
### Honeyfiles
- bait for the honeynet (passwords.txt)
