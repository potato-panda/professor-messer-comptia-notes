### The attacker can't get in

- not opening any email attachments
### Have the mountain come to you
- go where the mountain hangs out

- site vuln
- email attachments

### January 2017
### Polish Financial Supervision Authority, National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico, State-owned bank in Uruguay
