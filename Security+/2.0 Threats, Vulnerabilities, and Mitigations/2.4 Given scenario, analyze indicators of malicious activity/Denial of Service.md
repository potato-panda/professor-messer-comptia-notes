### Force a service to fail
- overload the service
### Take advantage of a design failure or vuln
- keep systems updated
### Cause system to be unavailable
- competitive advantage
### Create a smokescreen for some other exploit
- precursor to a DNS spoofing attack
### Doesn't have to be complicated
- turn off the power
# A "friendly" DoS
### Unintentionally DoSing
- isn't not always intentional
### Network DoS
- Layer 2 loop without STP
### Bandwidth DoS
- downloading multi-gigabyte Linux Distros over a DSL line
### The water line breaks
- get a good vacuum shop
# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
### Launch an army of computers to bring down a service
- uses all the bandwidth or resource - traffic spike
### This is why attackers have botnets
- thousands or millions of computers on command
- at its peak, Zeus botnet infected 3.6 million PCs
- coordinated attack
### Asymmetric threat
- the attacker may have fewer resources than victim
# DDoS reflection and amplification
### Turn your small attack into a big attack
- often reflected off another device or service
### An increasingly common network DDoS technique
- turn internet services against the victim
### Uses protocols with little (if any) auth or checks
- NTP, DNS, ICMP
- common example of protocol abuse
# DNS amplification DDoS
