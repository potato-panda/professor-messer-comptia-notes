# Rootkits
### Originally a Unix technique
- the "root" in rootkit
### Modified core system files
- part of the kernel
### Can be invisible to the OS
- won't see it in Task Manager
### Also invisible to traditional AV tools
- if you can't see it, you can't stop it
# Finding and removing rootkits
### Look for the unusual
- anti-malware scans
### Use a remover specific to the rootkit
- usually built after the rootkit is discovered
### Secure boot with UEFI
- security in the BIOS
