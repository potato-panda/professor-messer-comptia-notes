### Old-school security
- no keyboard, mouse, command line
### Many different ways to circumvent digital security
- a physical approach must be considered
### If you have physical access to a server, you have full control
- an OS can't stop in-person attacks
### Door locks keep out the honest people
- there's always a way in
# Brute force
### The physical version
- no password required
### Push through the obstruction
- brawn beats brains
### Check your physical security
- check the windows
- try the doors
### Attackers will try everything
- you should be prepared for anything
# RFID cloning
### Is everywhere
- access badges
- key fobs
### Duplicates are on Amazon
- less than $50
### The process takes seconds
- read one card
- copy to another
### This why we have MFA
- use another factor with the card
# Environmental attacks
### Attack everything supporting the technology
- the operating environment
### Power monitoring
- an obvious attack
### HVAC and humidity controls
- large data centers must be properly cooled
### Fire suppression
- watch for smoke or fire
