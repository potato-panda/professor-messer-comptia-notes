# Software updates
### Always keep your OS and apps updated
- updates often include bug fixes and security patches
### This process has its own security concerns
- not every updates is equally secure
### Follow best practices
- always have a known-good backup
- install from trusted sources
- **BACKUP**
# Downloading and updating
### Install updates from a downloaded file
- always consider your actions
- every installation could potentially be malicious
### Confirm the source
- a random pop-up during web browsing may not be legitimate
### Visit the dev's site directly
- don't trust random update button or random download file
### Many OS will only allow signed apps
- don't disable your security controls
# Automatic updates
### The app updates itself
- often included security checks / digital signatures
### Relatively trustworthy
- comes directly from the dev
### SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack
- reported in December 2020
- attackers gained access to the SolarWinds dev system
- added their own malicious code to the updates
- gained access to hundreds of government agencies and companies
