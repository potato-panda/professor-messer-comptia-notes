### Overwriting a buffer of memory
- spills over into other memory areas
### Devs need to perform bounds checking
- attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings
### Not a simple exploit
- takes time to avoid crashing things
- takes time to make it do what you want
### A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable
- which means a system can be compromised
