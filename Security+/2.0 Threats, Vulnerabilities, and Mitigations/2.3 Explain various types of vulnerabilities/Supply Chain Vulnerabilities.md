# Supply chain risk
### Chain contains many moving parts
- raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers
### Attackers can infect any step along the way
- infect different parts of chain without suspicion
- people trust their suppliers
### One exploit can infect the entire chain
- there's a lot at stake
# Service providers
### You can control your own security posture
- you can't always control a service provider
### Service providers often have access to internal services
- an opportunity for attackers
### Many different types of providers
- network, utility, office cleaning, payroll/accounting, cloud services, system admin, etc
### Consider ongoing security audits of all providers
- should be included with the contract
# Target service provider attack
### Target Corp. breach - November 2013
- 40 million credit cards stolen

- malware delivered in an email
- VPN creds for HVAC techs was stolen
### HVAC vendor was the supplier
- attackers used a wide-open Target network to infect every cash register at 1,800 stores
### To these technicians look like an IT security issue?
# Hardware providers
### Can you trust you new server/router/switch/firewall/software?
- supply chain cyber security
### Use a small supplier base
- tighter control of vendors
### Strict controls over policies and procedures
- ensure proper security is in place
### Security should be part of the overall design
- there's a limit to trust
# Cisco or not Cisco?
### All network traffic flows through switches and routers
- a perfect visibility and pivot point
### July 2022 - DHS arrests reseller CEO

- created over 30 different companies
- had been selling these since 2013
### Knock-offs made in China
- sold as authentic Cisco products
- until they start breaking and catching on fire
# Software providers
### Trust is a foundation of security
- every software installation questions our trust
### Initial installation
- digital signature should be confirmed during installation
### Updates and patches
- some software updates are automatic
- how secure are the updates?
### Open source is not immune
- compromising the source code itself
# SolarWinds supply chain attack

- used by 18,000 customers
- including Fortune 500 and US Fed Gov
