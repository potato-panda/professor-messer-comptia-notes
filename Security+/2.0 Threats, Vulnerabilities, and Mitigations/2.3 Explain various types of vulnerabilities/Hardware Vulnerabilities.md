### We are surrounded by hardware devices
- many do not have an accessible OS
### These devices are potential security risks
- a perfect entry point for attack
### Everything is connected to the network
- light bulbs, garage door, fridge, door locks
- IoT is everywhere
### The security landscape has grown
- time to change approach
# Firmware
### Software inside of hardware
- OS of hardware device
### Vendors are only ones who can fix their hardware
- assuming they are aware of the problems
- and care about fixing them
### Trane Comfortlink II thermostats
- control temp from phone
- Trane notified of 3 vulns in April 2014
- Two patched in April 2015, one in January 2016
# End-of-life (EOL)
- manufacturer stops selling a product
- many continue supporting the product
- important for security patches and updates
### End of service life (EOSL)
- manufacturer stops selling a product
- support is no longer available for the product
- no ongoing security patches or updates
- many have a premium cost support option
### Technology EOSL is a significant concern
- security patches are part of normal operation
# Legacy platforms
### Some devices remain installed for a long time
- perhaps too long
### Legacy devices
- older OS, apps, middleware
### May be running EOL software
- risk needs to be compared to return
### May require additional security protections
- additional firewall rules
- IPS signatures for older OS
