# Mobile device security
### Challenging to secure
- often need additional security policies and systems
### Relatively small
- can be almost invisible
### Almost always in motion
- you never know where it might be
### Packed with sensitive data
- personal and organizational
### Constantly connected to the Internet
- nothing bad happens on the Internet
# Jailbreaking/rooting
### Mobile devices are purpose-built systems
- you don't have access to the OS
### Gaining access
- Android - Rooting
- Apple iOS - Jailbreaking
### Install custom firmware
- replaces the existing OS
### Uncontrolled access
- circumvent security features
- the MDM becomes relatively useless
# Sideloading
### Malicious apps can be a significant security concern
- one Trojan horse can create a data breach
### Manage installation sources
- the global or local app store
### Sideloading circumvents security
- apps can be installed manually without using an app store
- again, your MDM becomes relatively useless
