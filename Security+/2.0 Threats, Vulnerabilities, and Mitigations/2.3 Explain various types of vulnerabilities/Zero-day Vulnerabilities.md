# Vulnerabilities
### Many apps have vulns
- we've not found them yet
### Someone is working hard to find the next big vuln
- the good guys share these with devs
### Attackers keep these yet-to-be discovered holes to themselves
- they want to use these vuln for personal gain
# Zero-day attacks
### Attackers search for unknown vulns
- they create exploits against these vulns
### The vendor has no idea the vuln exists
- they don't have a fix for an unknown problem
### Zero-day attacks
- an attack without a patch or method of mitigation
- a race to exploit the vuln or create a patch
- difficult to defend against the unknown
